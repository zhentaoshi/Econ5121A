Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have been teaching Econ5121A since 2015.
 These are companion notes for Hansen's textbook.
 They are lecture notes for students to peruse.
 They make a small subset of the contents covered by the textbook, while
 I consider they are the core topics for econometric theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this course, we will encounter more mathematics/statistics than economics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our focus is econometric theory, instead of econometric applications.

Philosophical Struggles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Econometrics is interdisciplinary.
 The fusion of philosophy, mathematics, statistics, economics, operational
 research, engineering and computing make it a very colorful and fascinating
 field to study.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I majored in finance when I was an undergraduate student.
 In the past years a few students asked me why I didn't continue with financial
 study.
 Although it was accidental that I switched to economics in my postgraduate
 study, I have never regretted my decision.

\begin_layout Section
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The textbook starts with a general-to-specific sequence.
 In this overview, we start with the specific-to-general presentation to
 better connect with undergraduate knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Conditional Mean
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most commonly used model in undergraduate statistics is the normal distribut
ion 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}\sim N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$
\end_inset

.
 A researcher collects a sample 
\begin_inset Formula $(y_{1},\ldots,y_{n})$
\end_inset

 and he is interested in estimate or conduct statistical inference about
 the parameters.
 Often 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is the parameter of interest, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 is a nuisance parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most commonly used econometric model we will study in this course is
 an multivariate extension of the above model.
 In the most restrictive form, we consider a mean model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{i}|(x_{1i},\ldots,x_{pi})\sim N(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1i}+\cdots\beta_{p}x_{pi},\sigma^{2})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in which the mean is 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1i}+\cdots\beta_{p}x_{pi}$
\end_inset

 may change across 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, instead of a fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 invariant across 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 The former includes the latter as a special case when 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}=\cdots=\beta_{p}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Our parameter of interest is the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0},\ldots,\beta_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 With the knowledge of these coefficients, for a new observation 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{1,n+1},\ldots,x_{p,n+1})$
\end_inset

 we know the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{n+1}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To simply notation, we write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{i}|x_{i}\sim N(\beta'x_{i},\sigma^{2})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}=(x_{1i},\ldots,x_{pi})'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{p})'$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slightly more generally, we don't need to assume the normality.
 Suppose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
E[y_{i}|x_{i}] & =\beta'x\\
\mathrm{var}[y_{i}|x_{i}] & =\sigma^{2}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we only restricts two moments, the conditional mean and conditional
 variance.
 This is the homoskedastic model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even more generally, we can assume
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E[y_{i}|x_{i}]=\beta'x
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the heterskedastic model in which we implicitly assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{var}[y_{i}|x_{i}]<\infty$
\end_inset

 but the variance may vary across 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why are we so interested in the conditional mean?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Look for associations.
 Example includes the minimal wage, consumption propensity, Phillips curve,
 effect of Covid-19 stimulus package, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Causal interpretation? Not yet.
 Unconfoundedness.
 (SUVTA?) 
\begin_inset Formula $((Y(1),Y(0))\perp D)|Z$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mean model is easy to estimate by minimizing a quadratic form.
 To be extended in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Principles of Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model is a description of the data generating process.
 Parameters are fixed, while random variables are

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

random
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In reality, we collect a sample of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 observations of the random variables, and we want to estimate the unknown
 parameter.
 Estimation is an educated guess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although there exists many estimators, the underlying principles of estimation
 are much fewer.
 The two common ones we will encounter in this course are the 
\emph on
likelihood principle
\emph default
 and the 
\emph on
moment principle
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Instrumental Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above conditional mean models and estimation principles are covered
 in undergraduate statistics.
 In this course, we will study them at the much deeper level.
 Other than that, in undergraduate econometrics we have also studied a special
 kind of model that economists are interested.
 That is the IV model.
 The most encounter form is that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E[(y_{i}-\beta'x_{i})|z_{i}]=0.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is, there exists a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $(1,-\beta')'$
\end_inset

 that linearly combines 
\begin_inset Formula $(y_{i},x'_{i})'$
\end_inset

 into a scalar variable 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}(\beta):=y_{i}-\beta x_{i}$
\end_inset

 such that its conditional mean on 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 0.
 The parameter of interest is the unknown 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 In econometrics, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}=(z_{1},\ldots,z_{l})'$
\end_inset

 is called the 
\emph on
instrumental variable
\emph default
.
 Oftentimes 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 are decided simultaneously in an economic system, so they are called the
 
\emph on
endogenous variables
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a model with economic characteristics.
 Originally, it was proposed by economists when they analyzed demand and
 supply in 1923.
 The most cited case is 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 being the price and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 being the quantity so they affect each other.
 In order to study the demand curve or the supply curve, we will need to
 bring some outside variables that cannot predict the

\end_inset

error
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

 from this system.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is often interpreted as representing some relationship between the endogenous
 variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Another overly cited example is education return.
 I prefer to move all variables to the left hand side and leave

\end_inset

 on the right-hand side.
 
\emph on
Income
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Years of education
\emph default
 are both outcomes of the fundamental ability of learning.
 Only because education is temporally prior to income so we normalize the
 parameter for 
\emph on
income
\emph default
 as 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common estimator for the linear IV model is 2SLS.
 Alternatively, under the likelihood principle we can also estimate the
 parameter by LIML.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model indeed includes the conditional mean model as a special case by
 setting 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}=x_{i}$
\end_inset

, so that obviously 
\begin_inset Formula $E[(y_{i}-\beta'x_{i})|z_{i}=x_{i}]=E[y_{i}|x_{i}]-\beta'x_{i}=0$
\end_inset

 by the law of expected expectations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am a native R speaker ever since my postgraduate study in Peking University
 in 2005, before which I had no serious commitment to any programming languages.
 R helps me with my daily research and teaching.
 R has many advantages.
 First, it inherits the standard program language syntax.
 Once you master R, it is easy to switch to other workplace languages if
 it is not R.
 Second, supported by a vast statistician community, R enjoys a large selection
 of packages, including the most recent ones.
 When they publish papers, many statisticians develop companion packages
 for researchers to adopt their methods.
 Third, R is free.
 It was the primary reason that I chose it at the very beginning.
 In the era of open-source software, an algorithm written in R is much easier
 to share, test, and improve, since anyone can run the code on any platform,
 free of license and fee headache.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
R is not without limitations.
 For example, speed is a concern when running big and complex jobs.
 However, it will not be an issue in the problems that we will encounter
 in this course.
