My lectures are based primarily on [Bruce Hansen's textbook](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/).

They are companions of the my in-class teaching,
but not substitute for lecture taking.


**Caveat**: This is an ongoing writing project not ready to publish.
The text is very incomplete, and must contain many errors. **Use them at your own risk!**
